# AlarmClock-Java
Here is a very simple console Alarm Clock in Java. The user can set an alarm in 24-hour format (HH:mm), the system current time is repeatedly checked by the application, and a 440 Hz beep sound is played upon the alarm time being reached. Unlike the majority of simple alarm implementations, this one does not require any third-party audio files â€” instead, the javax.sound.sampled library is employed for playing sound programmatically. The application is lightweight, platform-independent and can be run in any machine having Java 8 or newer in it.

Just clone the repository, build the AlarmClock.java file by running javac, and then run the application by java AlarmClock. You will then be asked for the alarm time. When the current system time matches you specified, the console will wake you up by a "Wake up!" message and five beeps for the alarm sound. The project structure is quite simple and includes one single Java file and this README.

Enhancement opportunities in the future might involve the implementation of a graphical interface with Swing or JavaFX, a snooze mode, providing for multi-alarm support, or even the acceptance of any audio file instead of tones generated. The project is a good springboard for first-time students of Java and provides a good introduction to handling user input, dealing with system time, and simple sound production. It's released under the MIT License and is open-source software and can therefore freely be adjusted and developed upon.
